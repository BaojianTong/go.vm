go.vm
-----

This project is a golang based compiler and interpreter for a simple virtual
machine.  It is a port of the existing project:

* https://github.com/skx/simple.vm

(The original project has a perl based compiler/decompiler and an interpreter
written in C.)

You can get a feel for what it looks like by referring to either the parent
project, or [the examples](examples/) contained in this repository.

This particular virtual machine is intentionally simple, but despite that it is hopefully implemented in a readable fashion.  ("Simplicity" here means that we support only a small number of instructions, and the 16-registers the virtual CPU possesses can store strings and integers, but not floating-point values.)


# Installation

Install the code via:

    $ go get -u  github.com/skx/go.vm
    $ go install github.com/skx/go.vm

Once installed there are three sub-commands of interest:

* `go.vm compile $file.in`
   * Compiles the given program into bytecode.
* `go.vm execute $file.raw`
   * Given the path to a file of bytecode, then interpret it.
* `go.vm run $file.in`
   * Compiles the specified program, then directly executes it.

So to compile the input-file `examples/hello.in` into bytecode:

     $ go.vm compile examples/hello.in

Then to execute the resulting bytecode:

     $ go.vm execute examples/hello.raw

Or you can handle both steps at once:

     $ go.vm run examples/hello.in


# Opcodes

The virtual machine has 16 registers, each of which can store an integer
or a string.  For example to set the first two registers you might write:

     store #0, "This is a string"
     store #1, 0xFFFF

In addition to this there are several mathematical operations which have
the general form:

     $operation $result, $src1, $src2

For example to add the contents of register #1 and register #2, storing
the result in register #0 you would write:

     add #0, #1, #2

Strings and integers may be displayed to STDOUT via:

     print_str #1
     print_int #3

Control-flow is supported via `call`, `ret` (for subroutines) and `jmp`
for absolute jumps.  You can also use the `Z`-flag which is set by
comparisons and the `inc`/`dec` instructions and make conditional jumps:

        store #1, 0x42
        cmp #1, 0x42
        jmpz ok

        store #1, "Something weird happened!\n"
        print_str #1
        exit
      :ok
        store #1, "Comparing register #01 to 0x42 succeeded!\n"
        print_str #1
        exit

Further instructions are available and can be viewed beneath [examples/](examples/).  The instruction-set is pretty limited, for example there is no notion of
reading from STDIN - however this _is_ supported via the use of traps, as [documented below](#traps).


# Notes

Some brief notes on parts of the code / operation:

## The compiler

The compiler is built in a traditional fashion:

* Input is split into tokens via [lexer.go](lexer/lexer.go)
  * This uses the [token.go](token/token.go) for the definition of constants.
* The stream of tokens is iterated over by [compiler.go](compiler/compiler.go)
  * This uses the constants in [opcode.go](opcode/opcode.go) for the bytecode generation.

The approach to labels is the same as in the inspiring-project:  Every time
we come across a label we output a pair of temporary bytes in our bytecode.
Later, once we've read the whole program and assume we've found all existing
labels,  we go back up and fix the generated addresses.

You can use the `dump` command to see the structure the lexer generates:

     $ go.vm dump ./examples/hello.in
     {STORE store}
     {IDENT #1}
     {, ,}
     {STRING Hello, World!
     }
     {PRINT_STR print_str}
     {IDENT #1}
     {EXIT exit}


## The interpreter

The core of the interpreter is located in the file [cpu.go](cpu/cpu.go) and is
as simple and naive as you would expect.  There are some supporting files
in the same directory:

* [register.go](cpu/register.go)
  * The implementation of the register-related functions.
* [stack.go](cpu/stack.go)
  * The implementation of the stack.
* [traps.go](cpu/traps.go)
  * The implementation of the traps, to be [described below](#traps).


## Changes

Compared to [the original project](https://github.com/skx/simple.vm) there are two main changes:

* The `DB`/`DATA` operation allows storing string data directly in the generated bytecode.
* There is a notion of `traps`.
   * Rather than defining opcodes for complex tasks it is now possible to callback into the CPU-emulator to do work.

#### DB/DATA Changes

For example in simple.vm project this is possible:

    DB 0x01, 0x02,

But this is not:

     DB "This is a string, with terminator to follow"
     DB 0x00

`go.vm` supports this, and it is demonstrated in [examples/peek-strlen.in](examples/peek-strlen.in).

#### Traps

The instruction `int` can be used to call back to the emulator to do some work
on behalf of a program.  The following traps are currently defined & available:

* `int 0x00`
   * Set the contents of the register `#0` with the length of the string in register `#0`.
* `int 0x01`
   * Set the contents of the register `#0` with a string entered by the user.
   * See [examples/trap.stdin.in](examples/trap.stdin.in).
* `int 0x02`
   * Update the (string) contents of register `#0` to remove any trailing newline.
   * See [examples/trap.box.in](examples/trap.box.in).

Adding your own trap-functions should be as simple as editing [cpu/traps.go](cpu/traps.go).


## Fuzzing

Fuzz-testing is a powerful technique to discover bugs, in brief it consists
of running a program with numerous random inputs and waiting for it to die.

I've fuzzed this repository repeatedly via [go-fuzz](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz) and fixed a couple of minor issues.

Note however that fuzzing will trigger some _expected_ failures.  Our virtual CPU has only 16 registers, so for example a program that tries to set register #30 to a particular value is invalid, and will terminate the virtual machine.

Because fuzzing involves using "random" input it is possible there are bugs lurking in the virtual-machine which I've not been lucky enough to catch, so if you wish to fuzz this is how you do it.   First of all install the tool:

     $ go get github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz/go-fuzz
     $ go get github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz/go-fuzz-build

Now you can build the interpreter using it:

     $ go-fuzz-build github.com/skx/go.vm/fuzz

Finally you can launch the fuzzer:

     $ go-fuzz -nprocs=1 -bin=fuzz-fuzz.zip -workdir=workdir

Interesting results will appear in `workdir/crashers/` some crashes will be invalid and you can see that via the `*.output` files which contain STDOUT from the run (more or less).  For example this is an "expected" failure:

     $ cat workdir/crashers/92108737efbd0ac6b42ae4473db5a257314b36cf.output
     Register 99 out of range
     exit status 1
